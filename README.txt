HOW the web portfolio was created, what techniques or technologies were used, what challenge were faced and how you over came them:

The web portfolio was created using four main navigation elements tucking in the corners of the web page with absolute positioning and margins of 5% based on the sides it was facing ex for the about button which is in the bottom left corner: margin-bottom: 5%, margin-left: 5%. and bottom:0, left: 0.
The carousel was made using divs. carousel < designs < image < text(span)
the css applied to is are flexbox with nowrap, overflow hidden, with scrollbar autohide.

*there was a click description on the images that would pop up as you will notice in the code, however I disabled some elements to hide it for the time being*

WHY some design / functional choices where made, their purpose, and future implementation of the web portfolio:

The design was made for a simple minimal aesthetic, easy navigation. I like the idea that the artwork is the focus of the website. The website revolves around the carousel and that's why it is layed out to give it as much breathing room as i could. future implementation of the web portfolio would be the image descriptions as mentioned above, possibly a shop for buying prints, and a projects section for bigger portfolio peices.

*note there are place holder images at the end of the carousel to demonstrate its functionaluty. I will be adding more artwork eventually as I  finish more projects.*

WHAT you learned from creating the web portfolio:

I learned that you can create unique layouts without using the basic format, header with nav, footer, and a menu. However, it has been proven that it's difficult to make responsive.
